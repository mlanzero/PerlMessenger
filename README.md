# PerlMessenger
Simple way to communicate on a closed network when you don't have admin rights.

Put all files in a shared directory. Open two term windows. 
One is for monitoring the message and the other is for 
sending messages. 

You will want to adjust the #! to your local perl. If you like,
you can add the full path for the text file if you move your 
perl scripts to another location. 

Unfortunatly I don't have access to Term::ReadKey with the version of 
perl installed. Any suggestions would be apperciated.
